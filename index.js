And well, as I've been turning the last few hours over in my head, it did occur to me that I have borne witness to something that may be of interest to you. You see, earlier in the evening I was relaxing in a nook of the library, my attention captured completely by a lovely collection of English Romantic poetry. I must have been decently obscured from my position in the nook, because at one point Mr. Green and Mr. Body passed through and did not notice that I was here! They were in the midst of a dispute, and though they spoke in hushed voices I could tell from their tones that something was wrong. I could not clearly make out much of what they were saying, but I believe the argument had something to do with art. Eventually the conversation came to a close and Mr. Green left the room, after which Mr. Body pull out a notebook from his back pocket and begin writing in it furiously. Oh, I'm so embarrassed for spying, but I worried that it would stir up trouble if I revealed my presence. I certainly did not want to involve myself in whatever they were arguing about, either.\nIn any event, I suspect that the notebook Mr. Body was writing in may hold some clues as to the nature of their conversation, so it may be worth your while to see if you can find it.
