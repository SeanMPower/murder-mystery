I've been collecting my thoughts here and trying to regain some sense of composure. The books, they always calm me down! And well, as I've been turning the last few hours over in my head, it did occur to me that I have borne witness to something that may be of interest to you. You see, earlier in the evening I was relaxing in a nook of the library, my attention captured completely by a lovely collection of English Romantic poetry. I must have been decently obscured from my position in the nook, because at one point Mr. Green and Mr. Body passed through and did not notice that I was here! They were in the midst of a dispute, and though they spoke in hushed voices I could tell from their tones that something was wrong. I could not clearly make out much of what they were saying, but I believe the argument had something to do with art. Eventually the conversation came to a close and Mr. Green left the room, after which Mr. Body pull out a notebook from his back pocket and begin writing in it furiously. Oh, I'm so embarrassed for spying, but I worried that it would stir up trouble if I revealed my presence. I certainly did not want to involve myself in whatever they were arguing about, either.\nIn any event, I suspect that the notebook Mr. Body was writing in may hold some clues as to the nature of their conversation, so it may be worth your while to see if you can find it. That's all the information I have for you, though I wish I could be of greater help!`;

I never did get to speak to Mr. Body at all tonight and it's a shame! He seemed like such an insightful fellow. Mr. Green was just telling me all about how interested Mr. Body was in his artwork. I've never much had an eye for art myself, but I surely have enjoyed walking around his Conservatory and looking at Mr. Green's wonderful plants! I highly suggest you check them out!\n\n*Mr. Green's eyes dart to Mrs. White nervously...*`;
